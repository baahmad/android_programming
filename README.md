I'm trying to develop a video communication app for piano instruction. The idea is that you livestream yourself playing a keyboard and the app, in real time,
transcribes and displays the notes you're playing on the screen. You can check the computer_music directory in my computer_vision repository for more
information on the algorithms used to make the note determination. In this repository, I will be experimenting with Android Studio to build my mobile application
programming skills.
